2024-03-10T15:58:06.5622314Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2024-03-10T15:58:06.5623217Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2024-03-10T15:58:06.5624549Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2024-03-10T15:58:06.5625373Z 
2024-03-10T15:58:06.5625666Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2024-03-10T15:58:06.5626678Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
2024-03-10T15:58:06.5627351Z 
2024-03-10T15:58:06.5627680Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2024-03-10T15:58:06.5628182Z 
2024-03-10T15:58:06.5628429Z Or undo this operation with:
2024-03-10T15:58:06.5628818Z 
2024-03-10T15:58:06.5629264Z   git switch -
