2024-03-10T15:58:06.0992220Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2024-03-10T15:58:06.0993200Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2024-03-10T15:58:06.0994690Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2024-03-10T15:58:06.0995292Z 
2024-03-10T15:58:06.0995957Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2024-03-10T15:58:06.0996858Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

2024-03-10T15:58:06.0997578Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2024-03-10T15:58:06.0997891Z 
2024-03-10T15:58:06.0998041Z Or undo this operation with:
2024-03-10T15:58:06.0998291Z 
2024-03-10T15:58:06.0998472Z   git switch -
