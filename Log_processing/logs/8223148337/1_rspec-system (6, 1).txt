2024-03-10T15:58:02.3950578Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2024-03-10T15:58:02.3951461Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2024-03-10T15:58:02.3952344Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2024-03-10T15:58:02.3952859Z 
2024-03-10T15:58:02.3953266Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2024-03-10T15:58:02.3955197Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
2024-03-10T15:58:02.3956114Z 
2024-03-10T15:58:02.3956558Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2024-03-10T15:58:02.3957137Z 
2024-03-10T15:58:02.3957574Z Or undo this operation with:
2024-03-10T15:58:02.3958113Z 
2024-03-10T15:58:02.3958459Z   git switch -
