2024-03-07T01:30:48.3345079Z Note: switching to 'refs/remotes/pull/4011/merge'.
2024-03-07T01:30:48.3346061Z 
2024-03-07T01:30:48.3346990Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2024-03-07T01:30:48.3348437Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2024-03-07T01:30:48.3349621Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2024-03-07T01:30:48.3350270Z 
2024-03-07T01:30:48.3350745Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2024-03-07T01:30:48.3352370Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
2024-03-07T01:30:48.3352816Z 
2024-03-07T01:30:48.3353007Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2024-03-07T01:30:48.3353258Z 
2024-03-07T01:30:48.3353454Z Or undo this operation with:
2024-03-07T01:30:48.3353773Z 
2024-03-07T01:30:48.3353933Z   git switch -
2024-03-07T01:30:48.3354109Z 
2024-03-07T01:30:48.3354413Z Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false
2024-03-07T01:30:48.3354902Z
