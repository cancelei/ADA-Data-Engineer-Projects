2024-03-07T01:30:47.4648648Z [command]/usr/bin/git checkout --progress --force refs/remotes/pull/4011/merge
2024-03-07T01:30:47.6097366Z Note: switching to 'refs/remotes/pull/4011/merge'.
2024-03-07T01:30:47.6098047Z 
2024-03-07T01:30:47.6098708Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2024-03-07T01:30:47.6099944Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2024-03-07T01:30:47.6101196Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2024-03-07T01:30:47.6101834Z 
2024-03-07T01:30:47.6102309Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2024-03-07T01:30:47.6103887Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
2024-03-07T01:30:47.6104337Z 
2024-03-07T01:30:47.6104701Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2024-03-07T01:30:47.6104968Z 
2024-03-07T01:30:47.6105145Z Or undo this operation with:
2024-03-07T01:30:47.6105381Z 
2024-03-07T01:30:47.6105503Z   git switch -
2024-03-07T01:30:47.6105804Z 
2024-03-07T01:30:47.6106116Z Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false
2024-03-07T01:30:47.6106590Z
