2024-03-07T01:53:29.3850412Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2024-03-07T01:53:29.3851348Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2024-03-07T01:53:29.3852553Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2024-03-07T01:53:29.3853251Z 
2024-03-07T01:53:29.3853544Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2024-03-07T01:53:29.3854370Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
2024-03-07T01:53:29.3854981Z 
2024-03-07T01:53:29.3855373Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2024-03-07T01:53:29.3855818Z 
2024-03-07T01:53:29.3856271Z Or undo this operation with:
2024-03-07T01:53:29.3856781Z
