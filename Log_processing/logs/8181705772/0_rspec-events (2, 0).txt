2024-03-07T01:53:30.7325441Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2024-03-07T01:53:30.7326715Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2024-03-07T01:53:30.7328141Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2024-03-07T01:53:30.7329362Z 
2024-03-07T01:53:30.7329969Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2024-03-07T01:53:30.7331449Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

2024-03-07T01:53:30.7332706Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2024-03-07T01:53:30.7333199Z 
2024-03-07T01:53:30.7333432Z Or undo this operation with:
2024-03-07T01:53:30.7333901Z
