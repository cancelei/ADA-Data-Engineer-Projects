2024-03-10T16:27:11.8361920Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2024-03-10T16:27:11.8363512Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2024-03-10T16:27:11.8364711Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2024-03-10T16:27:11.8365397Z 
2024-03-10T16:27:11.8365880Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2024-03-10T16:27:11.8367782Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
2024-03-10T16:27:11.8368528Z 
2024-03-10T16:27:11.8368919Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2024-03-10T16:27:11.8369427Z 
2024-03-10T16:27:11.8369654Z Or undo this operation with:
2024-03-10T16:27:11.8370190Z 
2024-03-10T16:27:11.8370439Z   git switch -
2024-03-10T16:27:11.8370741Z 
2024-03-10T16:27:11.8371274Z Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false
2024-03-10T16:27:11.8372092Z 
2024-03-10T16:27:11.8372894Z HEAD is now at e4bb56d Merge 67e0b0c1e96185c941a021cae2b1d27e0d4d61c4 into 5d90d05eabf617d15fa6b7ea8dbd7c39d8c6fced
