2024-03-10T16:27:09.8473842Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2024-03-10T16:27:09.8475201Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2024-03-10T16:27:09.8476375Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2024-03-10T16:27:09.8477052Z 
2024-03-10T16:27:09.8477513Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2024-03-10T16:27:09.8478474Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
2024-03-10T16:27:09.8478892Z 
2024-03-10T16:27:09.8479091Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2024-03-10T16:27:09.8479632Z 
2024-03-10T16:27:09.8479906Z Or undo this operation with:
2024-03-10T16:27:09.8480140Z 
2024-03-10T16:27:09.8480309Z   git switch -
