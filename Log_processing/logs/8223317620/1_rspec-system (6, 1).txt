2024-03-10T16:27:12.0321816Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2024-03-10T16:27:12.0323107Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2024-03-10T16:27:12.0324396Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2024-03-10T16:27:12.0325598Z 
2024-03-10T16:27:12.0326558Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2024-03-10T16:27:12.0328043Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

2024-03-10T16:27:12.0329224Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2024-03-10T16:27:12.0329687Z 
2024-03-10T16:27:12.0330062Z Or undo this operation with:
