2024-03-10T16:27:11.7800269Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2024-03-10T16:27:11.7801202Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2024-03-10T16:27:11.7802214Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2024-03-10T16:27:11.7803441Z 
2024-03-10T16:27:11.7804073Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2024-03-10T16:27:11.7805583Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

2024-03-10T16:27:11.7806736Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2024-03-10T16:27:11.7807196Z 
2024-03-10T16:27:11.7807500Z Or undo this operation with:
