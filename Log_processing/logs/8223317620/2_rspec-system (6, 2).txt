2024-03-10T16:27:11.8361927Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2024-03-10T16:27:11.8363520Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2024-03-10T16:27:11.8364719Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2024-03-10T16:27:11.8365403Z 
2024-03-10T16:27:11.8365929Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2024-03-10T16:27:11.8367809Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

2024-03-10T16:27:11.8368926Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2024-03-10T16:27:11.8369433Z 
2024-03-10T16:27:11.8369661Z Or undo this operation with:
