2024-02-17T06:02:16.5161046Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2024-02-17T06:02:16.5162256Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2024-02-17T06:02:16.5163242Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2024-02-17T06:02:16.5163800Z 
2024-02-17T06:02:16.5164180Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2024-02-17T06:02:16.5166231Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
2024-02-17T06:02:16.5167201Z 
2024-02-17T06:02:16.5167696Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2024-02-17T06:02:16.5168236Z 
2024-02-17T06:02:16.5168771Z Or undo this operation with:
2024-02-17T06:02:16.5169322Z 
2024-02-17T06:02:16.5169575Z   git switch -
2024-02-17T06:02:16.5169991Z 
2024-02-17T06:02:16.5170508Z Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false

2024-02-17T06:02:16.5172173Z HEAD is now at 92c6db4 Merge 3f5fde52e625609785b7b188df9f052183667ec1 into 4ba85b7982fa5e92c5fb79d29c2290054e6e16d8
