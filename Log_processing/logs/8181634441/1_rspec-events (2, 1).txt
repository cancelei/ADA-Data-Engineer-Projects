2024-03-07T01:45:38.0398289Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2024-03-07T01:45:38.0399548Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2024-03-07T01:45:38.0400705Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2024-03-07T01:45:38.0401864Z 
2024-03-07T01:45:38.0402350Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2024-03-07T01:45:38.0403518Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
2024-03-07T01:45:38.0403917Z 
2024-03-07T01:45:38.0404256Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2024-03-07T01:45:38.0404525Z 
2024-03-07T01:45:38.0404668Z Or undo this operation with:
2024-03-07T01:45:38.0404949Z
