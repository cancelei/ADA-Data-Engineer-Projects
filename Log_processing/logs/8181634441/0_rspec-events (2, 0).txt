2024-03-07T01:45:40.2996436Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2024-03-07T01:45:40.2997863Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2024-03-07T01:45:40.2999420Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2024-03-07T01:45:40.3000447Z 
2024-03-07T01:45:40.3001103Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2024-03-07T01:45:40.3002723Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
2024-03-07T01:45:40.3003278Z 
2024-03-07T01:45:40.3003502Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2024-03-07T01:45:40.3003772Z 
2024-03-07T01:45:40.3003952Z Or undo this operation with:
2024-03-07T01:45:40.3004186Z 
2024-03-07T01:45:40.3004413Z   git switch -
