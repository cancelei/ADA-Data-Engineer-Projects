2024-03-07T21:46:33.4879565Z Note: switching to 'refs/remotes/pull/4017/merge'.
2024-03-07T21:46:33.4880277Z 
2024-03-07T21:46:33.4880901Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2024-03-07T21:46:33.4882143Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2024-03-07T21:46:33.4883279Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2024-03-07T21:46:33.4884069Z 
2024-03-07T21:46:33.4884583Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2024-03-07T21:46:33.4885836Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
2024-03-07T21:46:33.4886264Z 
2024-03-07T21:46:33.4886449Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2024-03-07T21:46:33.4886792Z 
2024-03-07T21:46:33.4886985Z Or undo this operation with:
2024-03-07T21:46:33.4887215Z 
2024-03-07T21:46:33.4887337Z   git switch -
2024-03-07T21:46:33.4887549Z 
2024-03-07T21:46:33.4887851Z Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false
2024-03-07T21:46:33.4888390Z
