2024-03-07T21:46:35.4516445Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2024-03-07T21:46:35.4517598Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2024-03-07T21:46:35.4519242Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2024-03-07T21:46:35.4520130Z 
2024-03-07T21:46:35.4521375Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2024-03-07T21:46:35.4523242Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
2024-03-07T21:46:35.4524040Z 
2024-03-07T21:46:35.4524366Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2024-03-07T21:46:35.4524769Z 
2024-03-07T21:46:35.4525079Z Or undo this operation with:
2024-03-07T21:46:35.4525474Z 
2024-03-07T21:46:35.4525814Z   git switch -
