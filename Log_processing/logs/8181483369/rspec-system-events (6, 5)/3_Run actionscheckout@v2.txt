2024-03-07T01:30:52.6055186Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2024-03-07T01:30:52.6056294Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2024-03-07T01:30:52.6057315Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2024-03-07T01:30:52.6058039Z 
2024-03-07T01:30:52.6058452Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2024-03-07T01:30:52.6060068Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
2024-03-07T01:30:52.6061059Z 
2024-03-07T01:30:52.6061863Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2024-03-07T01:30:52.6062461Z 
2024-03-07T01:30:52.6062753Z Or undo this operation with:
2024-03-07T01:30:52.6063280Z 
2024-03-07T01:30:52.6063785Z   git switch -
2024-03-07T01:30:52.6064174Z 
2024-03-07T01:30:52.6064887Z Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false
2024-03-07T01:30:52.6065659Z 
2024-03-07T01:30:52.6066451Z HEAD is now at ecf7dd4 Merge 6b4ecc2b9f0d8b29a4d40fe4ee64bf5782b8324d into 7f9f88342ef6b65a71dc55d4f4cd2a4e751bcdbc
