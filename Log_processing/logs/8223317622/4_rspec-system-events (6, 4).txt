2024-03-10T16:27:14.3189119Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2024-03-10T16:27:14.3190282Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2024-03-10T16:27:14.3191453Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2024-03-10T16:27:14.3192158Z 
2024-03-10T16:27:14.3192714Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2024-03-10T16:27:14.3194111Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

2024-03-10T16:27:14.3195008Z 
2024-03-10T16:27:14.3195237Z Or undo this operation with:
