2024-03-10T16:27:09.2148492Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2024-03-10T16:27:09.2149853Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2024-03-10T16:27:09.2151318Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2024-03-10T16:27:09.2152220Z 
2024-03-10T16:27:09.2152900Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2024-03-10T16:27:09.2154770Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
2024-03-10T16:27:09.2155975Z 
2024-03-10T16:27:09.2156706Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2024-03-10T16:27:09.2157185Z 
2024-03-10T16:27:09.2157494Z Or undo this operation with:
2024-03-10T16:27:09.2157928Z
