2024-03-10T16:27:09.7480087Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2024-03-10T16:27:09.7481473Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2024-03-10T16:27:09.7482655Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2024-03-10T16:27:09.7483690Z 
2024-03-10T16:27:09.7484241Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2024-03-10T16:27:09.7485427Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

2024-03-10T16:27:09.7486025Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2024-03-10T16:27:09.7486318Z 
2024-03-10T16:27:09.7486459Z Or undo this operation with:
