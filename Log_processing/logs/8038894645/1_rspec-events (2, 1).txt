2024-02-25T15:12:27.0999896Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2024-02-25T15:12:27.1000919Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2024-02-25T15:12:27.1001762Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2024-02-25T15:12:27.1002241Z 
2024-02-25T15:12:27.1002552Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2024-02-25T15:12:27.1003859Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
2024-02-25T15:12:27.1004296Z 
2024-02-25T15:12:27.1004531Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2024-02-25T15:12:27.1004808Z 
2024-02-25T15:12:27.1004960Z Or undo this operation with:
2024-02-25T15:12:27.1005357Z 
2024-02-25T15:12:27.1005493Z   git switch -
