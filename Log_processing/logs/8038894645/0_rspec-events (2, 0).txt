2024-02-25T15:12:26.3878195Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2024-02-25T15:12:26.3879505Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2024-02-25T15:12:26.3880721Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2024-02-25T15:12:26.3881401Z 
2024-02-25T15:12:26.3882031Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2024-02-25T15:12:26.3883276Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
2024-02-25T15:12:26.3883965Z 
2024-02-25T15:12:26.3884170Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2024-02-25T15:12:26.3884574Z 
2024-02-25T15:12:26.3884746Z Or undo this operation with:
2024-02-25T15:12:26.3884989Z 
2024-02-25T15:12:26.3885157Z   git switch -
