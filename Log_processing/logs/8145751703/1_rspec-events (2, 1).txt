2024-03-04T19:16:02.5249815Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2024-03-04T19:16:02.5251285Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2024-03-04T19:16:02.5252213Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2024-03-04T19:16:02.5252842Z 
2024-03-04T19:16:02.5253247Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2024-03-04T19:16:02.5255015Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
2024-03-04T19:16:02.5256616Z 
2024-03-04T19:16:02.5257040Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2024-03-04T19:16:02.5257504Z 
2024-03-04T19:16:02.5257748Z Or undo this operation with:
2024-03-04T19:16:02.5258348Z 
2024-03-04T19:16:02.5258557Z   git switch -
