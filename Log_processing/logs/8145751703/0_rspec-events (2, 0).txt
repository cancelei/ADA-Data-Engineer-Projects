2024-03-04T19:16:02.1602575Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2024-03-04T19:16:02.1603755Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2024-03-04T19:16:02.1604696Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2024-03-04T19:16:02.1605540Z 
2024-03-04T19:16:02.1606393Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2024-03-04T19:16:02.1608483Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
2024-03-04T19:16:02.1609332Z 
2024-03-04T19:16:02.1609670Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2024-03-04T19:16:02.1610117Z 
2024-03-04T19:16:02.1610551Z Or undo this operation with:
2024-03-04T19:16:02.1610950Z 
2024-03-04T19:16:02.1611159Z   git switch -
