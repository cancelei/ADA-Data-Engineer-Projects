2024-03-07T01:49:12.9311651Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2024-03-07T01:49:12.9312908Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2024-03-07T01:49:12.9316108Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2024-03-07T01:49:12.9317215Z 
2024-03-07T01:49:12.9317903Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2024-03-07T01:49:12.9319230Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
2024-03-07T01:49:12.9319948Z 
2024-03-07T01:49:12.9320267Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2024-03-07T01:49:12.9320706Z 
2024-03-07T01:49:12.9321187Z Or undo this operation with:
2024-03-07T01:49:12.9321586Z 
2024-03-07T01:49:12.9321841Z   git switch -
2024-03-07T01:49:12.9322162Z 
2024-03-07T01:49:12.9322763Z Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false
2024-03-07T01:49:12.9323592Z 
2024-03-07T01:49:12.9324613Z HEAD is now at 4982200 Merge 4c1a0e0486dcc14eacd2ace78daabecb7936d79b into 7f9f88342ef6b65a71dc55d4f4cd2a4e751bcdbc
