2024-03-07T01:49:15.7941936Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2024-03-07T01:49:15.7943447Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2024-03-07T01:49:15.7944772Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2024-03-07T01:49:15.7945920Z 
2024-03-07T01:49:15.7946425Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2024-03-07T01:49:15.7948021Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
2024-03-07T01:49:15.7948782Z 
2024-03-07T01:49:15.7949200Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2024-03-07T01:49:15.7949662Z 
2024-03-07T01:49:15.7949901Z Or undo this operation with:
2024-03-07T01:49:15.7950559Z 
2024-03-07T01:49:15.7950785Z   git switch -
2024-03-07T01:49:15.7951171Z 
2024-03-07T01:49:15.7951769Z Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false

2024-03-07T01:49:15.7953739Z HEAD is now at 4982200 Merge 4c1a0e0486dcc14eacd2ace78daabecb7936d79b into 7f9f88342ef6b65a71dc55d4f4cd2a4e751bcdbc
