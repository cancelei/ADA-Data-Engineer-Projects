2024-03-10T15:01:50.5372044Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2024-03-10T15:01:50.5372980Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2024-03-10T15:01:50.5373947Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2024-03-10T15:01:50.5374969Z 
2024-03-10T15:01:50.5375538Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2024-03-10T15:01:50.5377197Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

2024-03-10T15:01:50.5379030Z 
2024-03-10T15:01:50.5379286Z Or undo this operation with:
