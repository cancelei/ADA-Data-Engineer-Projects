2024-03-10T15:01:51.0417974Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2024-03-10T15:01:51.0419162Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2024-03-10T15:01:51.0420361Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2024-03-10T15:01:51.0421429Z 
2024-03-10T15:01:51.0421959Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2024-03-10T15:01:51.0423262Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
2024-03-10T15:01:51.0423683Z 
2024-03-10T15:01:51.0423881Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2024-03-10T15:01:51.0424469Z 
2024-03-10T15:01:51.0424631Z Or undo this operation with:
2024-03-10T15:01:51.0424922Z 
2024-03-10T15:01:51.0425045Z   git switch -
