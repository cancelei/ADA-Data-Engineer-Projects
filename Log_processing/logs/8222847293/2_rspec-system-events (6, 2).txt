2024-03-10T15:01:50.6163464Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2024-03-10T15:01:50.6164387Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2024-03-10T15:01:50.6165188Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2024-03-10T15:01:50.6165864Z 
2024-03-10T15:01:50.6166171Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2024-03-10T15:01:50.6167220Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

2024-03-10T15:01:50.6168931Z 
2024-03-10T15:01:50.6169255Z Or undo this operation with:
