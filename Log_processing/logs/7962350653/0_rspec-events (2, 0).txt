2024-02-19T16:08:06.7196381Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2024-02-19T16:08:06.7197525Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2024-02-19T16:08:06.7198413Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2024-02-19T16:08:06.7198971Z 
2024-02-19T16:08:06.7199753Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2024-02-19T16:08:06.7201562Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
2024-02-19T16:08:06.7202760Z 
2024-02-19T16:08:06.7203131Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2024-02-19T16:08:06.7203715Z 
2024-02-19T16:08:06.7203952Z Or undo this operation with:
2024-02-19T16:08:06.7204596Z 
2024-02-19T16:08:06.7204807Z   git switch -
