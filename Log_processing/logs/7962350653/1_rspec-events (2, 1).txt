2024-02-19T16:08:10.3045530Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2024-02-19T16:08:10.3046762Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2024-02-19T16:08:10.3048073Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2024-02-19T16:08:10.3048988Z 
2024-02-19T16:08:10.3049558Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2024-02-19T16:08:10.3051273Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
2024-02-19T16:08:10.3052133Z 
2024-02-19T16:08:10.3052465Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2024-02-19T16:08:10.3052988Z 
2024-02-19T16:08:10.3053271Z Or undo this operation with:
2024-02-19T16:08:10.3053690Z 
2024-02-19T16:08:10.3053897Z   git switch -
