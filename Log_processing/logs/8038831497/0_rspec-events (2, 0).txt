2024-02-25T15:03:27.0634090Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2024-02-25T15:03:27.0635449Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2024-02-25T15:03:27.0636788Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2024-02-25T15:03:27.0637792Z 
2024-02-25T15:03:27.0638346Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2024-02-25T15:03:27.0639584Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
2024-02-25T15:03:27.0640035Z 
2024-02-25T15:03:27.0640335Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2024-02-25T15:03:27.0640660Z 
2024-02-25T15:03:27.0640826Z Or undo this operation with:
2024-02-25T15:03:27.0641061Z
