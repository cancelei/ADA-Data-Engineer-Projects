2024-02-25T15:03:25.0132078Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2024-02-25T15:03:25.0133289Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2024-02-25T15:03:25.0134531Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2024-02-25T15:03:25.0135286Z 
2024-02-25T15:03:25.0135596Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2024-02-25T15:03:25.0136689Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
2024-02-25T15:03:25.0137123Z 
2024-02-25T15:03:25.0137307Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2024-02-25T15:03:25.0137641Z 
2024-02-25T15:03:25.0137814Z Or undo this operation with:
2024-02-25T15:03:25.0138045Z
