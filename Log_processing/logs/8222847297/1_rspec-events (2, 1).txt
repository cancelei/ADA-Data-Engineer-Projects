2024-03-10T15:01:49.7542072Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2024-03-10T15:01:49.7543589Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2024-03-10T15:01:49.7545624Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2024-03-10T15:01:49.7546280Z 
2024-03-10T15:01:49.7608282Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2024-03-10T15:01:49.7610521Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
2024-03-10T15:01:49.7611259Z 
2024-03-10T15:01:49.7611604Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2024-03-10T15:01:49.7612029Z 
2024-03-10T15:01:49.7612458Z Or undo this operation with:
2024-03-10T15:01:49.7612860Z 
2024-03-10T15:01:49.7613130Z   git switch -
