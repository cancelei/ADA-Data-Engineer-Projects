2024-03-10T15:01:49.0589663Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2024-03-10T15:01:49.0590640Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2024-03-10T15:01:49.0591775Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2024-03-10T15:01:49.0592271Z 
2024-03-10T15:01:49.0592760Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2024-03-10T15:01:49.0594410Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
2024-03-10T15:01:49.0595546Z 
2024-03-10T15:01:49.0596218Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2024-03-10T15:01:49.0596720Z 
2024-03-10T15:01:49.0596958Z Or undo this operation with:
2024-03-10T15:01:49.0597355Z 
2024-03-10T15:01:49.0597748Z   git switch -
