2024-02-26T18:14:22.1556912Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2024-02-26T18:14:22.1558113Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2024-02-26T18:14:22.1559054Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2024-02-26T18:14:22.1559628Z 
2024-02-26T18:14:22.1559999Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2024-02-26T18:14:22.1562392Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
2024-02-26T18:14:22.1563098Z 
2024-02-26T18:14:22.1563425Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2024-02-26T18:14:22.1563871Z 
2024-02-26T18:14:22.1564095Z Or undo this operation with:
