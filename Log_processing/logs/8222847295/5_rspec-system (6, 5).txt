2024-03-10T15:01:53.9174431Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2024-03-10T15:01:53.9175430Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2024-03-10T15:01:53.9176402Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
