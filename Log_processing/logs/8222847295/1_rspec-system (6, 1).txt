2024-03-10T15:01:51.2451986Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2024-03-10T15:01:51.2454504Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2024-03-10T15:01:51.2455726Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2024-03-10T15:01:51.2456380Z 
2024-03-10T15:01:51.2456835Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2024-03-10T15:01:51.2458521Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
2024-03-10T15:01:51.2459196Z 
2024-03-10T15:01:51.2459527Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2024-03-10T15:01:51.2460017Z 
2024-03-10T15:01:51.2460461Z Or undo this operation with:
2024-03-10T15:01:51.2460954Z 
2024-03-10T15:01:51.2461215Z   git switch -
2024-03-10T15:01:51.2461499Z 
2024-03-10T15:01:51.2461938Z Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false
