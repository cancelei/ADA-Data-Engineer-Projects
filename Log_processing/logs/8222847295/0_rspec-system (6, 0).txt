2024-03-10T15:01:53.5366828Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2024-03-10T15:01:53.5367783Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2024-03-10T15:01:53.5369018Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2024-03-10T15:01:53.5369511Z 
2024-03-10T15:01:53.5369903Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2024-03-10T15:01:53.5371588Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
2024-03-10T15:01:53.5373078Z 
2024-03-10T15:01:53.5373494Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2024-03-10T15:01:53.5374121Z 
2024-03-10T15:01:53.5374412Z Or undo this operation with:
2024-03-10T15:01:53.5374906Z
