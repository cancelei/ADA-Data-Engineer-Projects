2024-03-10T15:58:02.3455719Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2024-03-10T15:58:02.3456663Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2024-03-10T15:58:02.3457635Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2024-03-10T15:58:02.3458152Z 
2024-03-10T15:58:02.3458597Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2024-03-10T15:58:02.3460109Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

2024-03-10T15:58:02.3461661Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2024-03-10T15:58:02.3462509Z 
2024-03-10T15:58:02.3462881Z Or undo this operation with:
