2024-03-10T15:58:04.0371182Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2024-03-10T15:58:04.0372514Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2024-03-10T15:58:04.0374046Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
