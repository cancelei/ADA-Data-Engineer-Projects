2024-03-10T15:58:05.4078801Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2024-03-10T15:58:05.4080162Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2024-03-10T15:58:05.4081366Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2024-03-10T15:58:05.4082017Z 
2024-03-10T15:58:05.4082525Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2024-03-10T15:58:05.4083549Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
2024-03-10T15:58:05.4084403Z 
2024-03-10T15:58:05.4084603Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2024-03-10T15:58:05.4084903Z 
2024-03-10T15:58:05.4085045Z Or undo this operation with:
2024-03-10T15:58:05.4085295Z 
2024-03-10T15:58:05.4085548Z   git switch -
