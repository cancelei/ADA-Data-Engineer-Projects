2024-03-04T13:51:19.8598471Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2024-03-04T13:51:19.8599754Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2024-03-04T13:51:19.8601103Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2024-03-04T13:51:19.8602138Z 
2024-03-04T13:51:19.8602601Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2024-03-04T13:51:19.8603917Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
2024-03-04T13:51:19.8604669Z 
2024-03-04T13:51:19.8605026Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2024-03-04T13:51:19.8605469Z 
2024-03-04T13:51:19.8605689Z Or undo this operation with:
2024-03-04T13:51:19.8606117Z 
2024-03-04T13:51:19.8606316Z   git switch -

2024-03-04T13:51:19.8607375Z Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false
