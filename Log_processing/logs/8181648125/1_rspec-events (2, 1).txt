2024-03-07T01:47:41.2744900Z [command]/usr/bin/git checkout --progress --force refs/remotes/pull/4011/merge
2024-03-07T01:47:41.4087316Z Note: switching to 'refs/remotes/pull/4011/merge'.
2024-03-07T01:47:41.4088111Z 
2024-03-07T01:47:41.4088854Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2024-03-07T01:47:41.4090146Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2024-03-07T01:47:41.4091291Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2024-03-07T01:47:41.4092604Z 
2024-03-07T01:47:41.4093094Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2024-03-07T01:47:41.4098001Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
2024-03-07T01:47:41.4098661Z 
2024-03-07T01:47:41.4099207Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2024-03-07T01:47:41.4099699Z 
2024-03-07T01:47:41.4099952Z Or undo this operation with:
2024-03-07T01:47:41.4100486Z 
2024-03-07T01:47:41.4100686Z   git switch -
2024-03-07T01:47:41.4100976Z 
2024-03-07T01:47:41.4101545Z Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false
2024-03-07T01:47:41.4102279Z 
2024-03-07T01:47:41.4102894Z HEAD is now at 4982200 Merge 4c1a0e0486dcc14eacd2ace78daabecb7936d79b into 7f9f88342ef6b65a71dc55d4f4cd2a4e751bcdbc
