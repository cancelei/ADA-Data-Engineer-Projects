2024-03-07T01:47:39.6741641Z Note: switching to 'refs/remotes/pull/4011/merge'.
2024-03-07T01:47:39.6742237Z 
2024-03-07T01:47:39.6742905Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2024-03-07T01:47:39.6744058Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2024-03-07T01:47:39.6745344Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2024-03-07T01:47:39.6746056Z 
2024-03-07T01:47:39.6746523Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2024-03-07T01:47:39.6747917Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
2024-03-07T01:47:39.6748408Z 
2024-03-07T01:47:39.6748605Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2024-03-07T01:47:39.6748901Z 
2024-03-07T01:47:39.6749043Z Or undo this operation with:
2024-03-07T01:47:39.6749328Z 
2024-03-07T01:47:39.6749449Z   git switch -
2024-03-07T01:47:39.6749694Z 
2024-03-07T01:47:39.6750045Z Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false
2024-03-07T01:47:39.6750477Z
