2024-02-25T15:15:52.9393250Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2024-02-25T15:15:52.9394029Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2024-02-25T15:15:52.9394889Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2024-02-25T15:15:52.9395353Z 
2024-02-25T15:15:52.9395670Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2024-02-25T15:15:52.9396506Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
2024-02-25T15:15:52.9397504Z 
2024-02-25T15:15:52.9398065Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2024-02-25T15:15:52.9398537Z 
2024-02-25T15:15:52.9399016Z Or undo this operation with:
2024-02-25T15:15:52.9399485Z 
2024-02-25T15:15:52.9399688Z   git switch -
