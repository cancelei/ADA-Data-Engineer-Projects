2024-02-25T15:15:48.5368178Z [command]/usr/bin/git checkout --progress --force refs/remotes/pull/3788/merge
2024-02-25T15:15:48.6704655Z Note: switching to 'refs/remotes/pull/3788/merge'.
2024-02-25T15:15:48.6705464Z 
2024-02-25T15:15:48.6706161Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2024-02-25T15:15:48.6707377Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2024-02-25T15:15:48.6708600Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2024-02-25T15:15:48.6709407Z 
2024-02-25T15:15:48.6709868Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2024-02-25T15:15:48.6711499Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
2024-02-25T15:15:48.6712077Z 
2024-02-25T15:15:48.6712416Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2024-02-25T15:15:48.6712687Z 
2024-02-25T15:15:48.6712834Z Or undo this operation with:
2024-02-25T15:15:48.6713108Z 
2024-02-25T15:15:48.6713250Z   git switch -
2024-02-25T15:15:48.6713466Z 
2024-02-25T15:15:48.6713852Z Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false
2024-02-25T15:15:48.6714297Z 
2024-02-25T15:15:48.6714790Z HEAD is now at 875017f Merge d7757c511a9e083dfd43193b531ba4a2ea29c92b into 29159218110b9d1a8fc408939ef1202b3b1d766e
